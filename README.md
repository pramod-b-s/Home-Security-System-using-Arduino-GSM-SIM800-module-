# Home-Security-System-using-Arduino-GSM-SIM800-module
This is an IoT project that uses ultrasonic sensors, connected to an Arduino Uno which instructs the GSM SIM800 module 
to alert the user in case of intrusions by sending a SMS message. 
To activate the alarm, a certain code(*#$) must be sent to the phone number present 
in the SIM800 module SIM slot. It checks every 15 minutes for intrusions.
